What is Downsaver?
==================

The name Downsaver is "download" and "save" combined. Downsaver is a browser add-on (currently support Mozilla Firefox only; the support for other browsers might be added in the future). It makes a browser automatically save video/audio/image or any other online resources to the disk while they being loaded. In addition, since you won't need to sniff resource's URL before it's saved, a second HTTP request can be avoided which saves your bandwidth and your time.

NOTE: Downsaver is still under alpha development stage. Users without programming skills are not encouraged to use it.
